# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We appreciate your interest and welcome contributions from the community. Whether you're reporting a bug, proposing a new feature, or improving our documentation, your input is valuable.

Here's how you can get involved and contribute to the project:

## üìñ Code of Conduct

Help team SpitFire be the best. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)


## üì• Opening an Issue

Before creating issues, search through existing [issues](#github-issues) to see if your issue has previously been reported. If your issue exists, comment with any additional information you have. You may simply note "I have this problem too", which helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

### üêõ Bug Reports

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report. ‚úåÔ∏è

Since we are developers, we should write bug reports as a ticket that you would like to receive.

**Fully complete the provided [issue template](https://github.com/hngx-org/Spitfire-events-backend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=%5BBug%5D+).** The bug report template requests all the information we need to quickly and efficiently address your issue. Be clear, concise, and descriptive. Provide as much information as you can, including steps to reproduce, stack traces, compiler errors, library versions, OS versions, and screenshots (if applicable).

### ‚õ≤ Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a new feature or improvement that you'd like to see in this project, please let us know üôåüèΩ.

**Fully complete the provided [issue template](https://github.com/hngx-org/Spitfire-events-backend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=feature_functionality_request.yaml&title=%5BFeature+Request%5D+)**. The feature request template asks for all necessary information for us to begin a productive conversation. Be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it relates to existing features. Include implementation details if possible.

## üìå Pull Requests
We love pull requests! Before forking the repo and creating a pull request, it is usually best to first open an issue (if one doesn't exist) to discuss the changes, or discuss your intended approach for solving the problem in the comments for an existing issue.

**Prioritize understanding over cleverness.** Write code clearly and concisely. Remember that source code usually gets written once and read often. Ensure the code is clear to the reader. The purpose and logic should be obvious to a reasonably skilled developer, otherwise you should add a comment that explains it.

**Follow existing coding style and conventions**. Keep your code consistent with the  [Pep 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style, formatting, and conventions in the rest of the code base. When possible, these will be enforced with a linter. Consistency makes it easier to review and modify in the future.

**Include test coverage.** Add tests when possible. Follow existing patterns for implementing tests.

**Add documentation.** Document your changes with code doc comments or in existing guides like README.md or DOCUMENTATION.md if affected.

**Update the CHANGELOG for all enhancements and bug fixes**. Include the corresponding issue number if one exists, and your GitHub username. (example: "- Fixed crash in profile view. #123 @jessesquires")

Resolve any merge conflicts that occur.

Promptly address any CI failures. If your pull request fails to build or pass tests, please push another commit to fix it.

When writing comments, use properly constructed sentences, including punctuation.
